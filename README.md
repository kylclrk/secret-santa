# secret-santa

Well, hello there. You've stumbled across a pretty boring repository. This is just an easy way for my family to draw names for an annual Secret Santa. We didn't want to keep getting the same people and we also didn't want to get our spouses, so I made this quick and dirty little script that will run in the browser console. Eventually we might move to an actual database with a frontend and everything. But that doesn't pay the bills, so here we are.
